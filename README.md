## 🔑 Key Insights

- **Marketing campaigns are the main revenue engine**, contributing **over 60% of total revenue**, which confirms that paid media is not just a support channel but a core growth driver.

- **Revenue is highly concentrated** in a small group of campaigns and SKUs. A limited number of high-ROAS campaigns generate most Ads revenue, while many campaigns deliver low or marginal returns.

- **Product selection strongly impacts campaign success**. Certain categories and SKUs consistently outperform others in Ads-driven sales, indicating that campaign efficiency depends heavily on what is being promoted, not only on spend.

- **VIP and Membership customers contribute a disproportionately high share of revenue**, highlighting the importance of segmentation, retention, and remarketing strategies.

- Funnel analysis shows a **notable drop-off from Click to Order**, suggesting that conversion performance is more constrained by landing experience, offer design, or targeting quality than by traffic volume.

## 🎯 Recommendations

- **Reallocate budget toward high-performing campaigns**
      + Scale spend on campaigns and SKUs with consistently high ROAS.
      + Reduce or pause campaigns with low ROAS and high CPA to improve overall efficiency.

- **Build an Ads-focused product strategy**
      + Prioritize products with strong margins and proven Ads performance.
      + Apply bundling and cross-selling strategies to increase AOV on top-selling SKUs.

- **Optimize conversion before increasing spend**
      + Improve landing pages and messaging for campaigns with strong CTR but weak conversion.
      + Refine audience targeting for mid-performing campaigns before scaling budgets.

- **Strengthen customer value management**
      + Design dedicated campaigns for VIP and Membership segments.
      + Increase remarketing efforts to reduce reliance on cold traffic and improve customer lifetime value (CLV).

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add customer lifetime value (CLV) analysis
- Integrate retention and repeat purchase tracking
